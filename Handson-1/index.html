    <p>When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies astyle to multiple elements. ID, on the other hand, applies a style to one unipue element. ID is also spacial in that you can use a spacial URL to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript. </p>
    <p>In CSS, selectors are used to target a spacific element or range of elements on a web page. Once an element has been targeted,a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.</p>
    <p>There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to targer elements to which a style should be applied.</p>
